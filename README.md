## Future Enhancements and Scope

- **Full Stack Development**: The current implementation delivers a fully-featured frontend web application. Future iterations will extend the schema to support complete full-stack application generation.

- **GitHub Authentication**: Implementation of proper GitHub authentication is planned. Currently, the application requires users to manually provide their GitHub username and personal access token(at developer lavel) due to time constraints.

- **Web Framework Integration**: The current version generates websites using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Future updates will incorporate support for modern frameworks such as React, Angular, and others.

- **Comprehensive Software Development Platform**: Future development aims to evolve the tool into a fully-fledged software development environment with integrated testing, deployment pipelines, and collaborative features to support end-to-end application lifecycle management.
